# üìò C++ Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to mastering C++ programming, data structures, and algorithms. It is structured to complement the [Complete C++ DSA Course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe137I_EPQd34TsgV6IO55pt) by [Apna College](https://www.youtube.com/@ApnaCollegeOfficial), providing code implementations, problem-solving techniques, and detailed explanations.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories that correspond to specific topics covered in the course:

* `00_Advance Problems in C`
* `00_Most Advance Techniques in C++`
* `01 - Basics of DataType & Operators`
* `02 - If else Conditions & Loops`
* `03 - Nested Loops & Patterns`
* `04 - Functions in C++`
* `05 - Binary Number System`
* `06 - DataType Modifiers & Bitwise Operators`
* `07 - Arrays in C++`
* `08 - Vectors Array Like data Structure`
* `09 - Algo_Kadane's Algorithm`
* `10 - Moore's Voting Algorithm (Brute-Better-Best Approach)`
* `11 - Time & Space Complexity`
* `13 - Container with Most Water Problem`
* `14 - Product of Array Except Self`

Each directory contains C++ source files (`.cpp`) with well-commented code and, where applicable, input/output examples to facilitate understanding.

## üìñ Topics Covered

The course and repository cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

* Basic to advanced C++ programming concepts.
* Control structures: if-else, loops, switch-case.
* Functions and recursion.
* Arrays, vectors, and strings.
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
* Standard Template Library (STL): vectors, stacks, queues, maps, sets.
* Sorting and searching algorithms.
* Bit manipulation techniques.
* Dynamic programming and greedy algorithms.
* Graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm.

## üß† Problem-Solving Approach

For each algorithm or data structure, the repository provides:

* A clear problem statement.
* Multiple solution approaches (brute-force, optimized).
* Time and space complexity analysis.
* Code implementation with comments.
* Test cases and edge case considerations.
