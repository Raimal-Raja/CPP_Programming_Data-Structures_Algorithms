// vectors are dynamic integers, becuase it has not a fixed size,
// STL a library that contain most of data structure implementation code 
// STL = standard Template Library 
// data storing containers are called STL (vector, queue, stack, set)
//  by default vector is 0


// memory  allocation, static memory allocate at compile time and dynamic memory allocate at runtime
// declaring vector store in static memory
// initialization stores in dynamic memory
//  vector is internally a array

// each time when capacity reach it's level, it doubles itself in vectors
