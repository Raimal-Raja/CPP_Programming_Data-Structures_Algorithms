// time complexity is not the actual time taken but amount of time taken as function of input size(n).
// number of operation or process occurs
// number of input increases it will increase number of operations
//  y = x 
// f(x) = x => O(n)

// big O notation give us, worst case sinario or worst case complexity, that is also called (upper bound)
// worst case complexity  = big O (upper bound)
// average case complexity = thita
// best case complexity = omega (lower bound)
